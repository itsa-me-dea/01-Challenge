## Description

This project was meant to fulfill an on-the-job ticket. The task was to improve accessibility standards by adding HTML semantic elements so that the client's site is optimized for search engines (i.e. search engine optimization or SEO) and for disabled accessibility. 

For in-depth details on changes and new additions. See the HTML and CSS document comments. In general, most elements were changed from non-semantic elements (e.g. `<div>`) to semantic elements (e.g. `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) for improved accessibility.

I learned a great deal in the importance of semantic elements and the ability to establish clear elements not only for the user, but for the developer as well. I also had the opportunity to work more with `class` and `id` elements, and ustilizing those to better optimize or consolidate code.
